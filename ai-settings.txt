In a grim, medieval world, a young peasant named Aldric discovers that he has been cursed with a dark and mysterious power. As he struggles to understand and control this newfound ability, he learns that it comes at a terrible price: each time he uses it, a piece of his humanity is consumed, and he edges closer to becoming a monstrous being.
Desperate to break the curse, Aldric sets out on a perilous journey to find the ancient witch who cast the spell upon him. Along the way, he encounters hostile villagers who fear his growing power, ruthless mercenaries seeking to exploit his abilities, and terrifying creatures born from the shadows of his own mind.
As Aldric delves deeper into the dark secrets of the world around him, he begins to question whether the curse is truly a burden or a gift. The power it grants him is seductive, and he finds himself drawn to the very darkness he once feared.
With each passing day, Aldric's grip on his sanity weakens, and he must confront the horrifying truth that the greatest threat to his humanity may not be the curse itself, but the twisted desires it awakens within him. His quest becomes a race against time as he struggles to find a way to break the curse before it consumes him entirely, leaving him as a hollow shell of his former self, forever lost to the darkness.

In a secluded castle nestled deep within a misty, foreboding forest, a young nobleman named Aldric finds himself trapped among a court of immortals. The castle's inhabitants, once human, have been cursed with eternal life by an ancient, malevolent entity that feeds on their despair and misery.
As Aldric navigates the twisted corridors and grand halls of the castle, he discovers that immortality comes at a terrible price.

Aldric soon learns that he, too, has been cursed with immortality upon entering the castle, and there is no escape from this eternal nightmare. The entity that controls the castle takes a particular interest in Aldric, tormenting him with visions of his darkest fears and tempting him with promises of power and release.

With each passing day, Aldric's dread grows as he realizes that he is doomed to spend eternity trapped within the castle's walls, forever at the mercy of the malevolent entity and the twisted immortals who inhabit it. His only hope lies in unraveling the secrets of the castle and the curse that binds them all, but doing so may require him to confront the darkest parts of his own soul and risk losing himself in the process.
