- have a zelda 2 style shield for proyectiles (can be use a defence mechanism for having a short ranged weapon)

- maybe you can deal more damage if you hit an enemy on the air? jumping and timing the hit for an enemy is really tricky and satisfying

- have an enemy that can only be hurt from behind (you have to jump over it, prepare the stab and hit it from behind)
