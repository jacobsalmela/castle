"King Arawn sits upon a throne of lies, a god in name, but a prisoner in truth. His kingdom eternal, his reign unending, his subjects forever cursed."
"Here lies the First Death, a beacon of hope in a land where death is a dream. They say he escaped the curse, yet his tomb remains empty, a mystery for the faithful."
"The Dreamer watches, an unseen puppet master pulling strings of fate. His barrier a cruel jest, his intentions a riddle lost to the ages."
"Gold and death, both equally worthless here."
"A king’s splendor, built on borrowed time. The Dreamer’s eye sees all, and eternity’s price is paid in echoes of stolen grace."
"Leaves fall and bloom in the same breath, as years become whispers. The garden remembers what the world forgets."
"Books whisper secrets that span eons in mere moments. Wisdom here is a river that drowns as it enlightens."
"Laughter in the shadows, gold that glitters without gleam. In Ferragus' realm, despair stretches thin, and time coils upon itself."
